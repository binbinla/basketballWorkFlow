# Interest For Basketball
Combine with code and interest. Basketball fans are all over the world, I am one of them.  NBA is a familiar place for many basketball fans, we watch NBA games and keep up to date. This project was born for fans, it's a platform where technology and interest converge. 

If you have any suggestions or topic about basketball or APP features, welcome to [contact me](https://github.com/binbinla) or leave an issue. Hope to get a tart from you, I will continue to update and perfect the project.
